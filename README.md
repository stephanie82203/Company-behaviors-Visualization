# HR Analytics in R

This project contains R scripts analyzing HR data, focusing on:
- Performance Scores â€“ Relationship between employer and performance.
- Diversity Profile â€“ Workforce composition analysis.
- Recruiting Sources â€“ Best sources for diversity.
- Attrition Prediction â€“ Who is likely to leave?
- Pay Equity â€“ Identifying wage disparities.

ðŸ“Œ This repository currently contains only the code that answers these questions as part of an academic assignment. It will be expanded into a full project with improved analysis and visualization.

## Install R and the required packages
```install.packages(c("lattice","ggplot2","dplyr"))```

## Future Enhancements
1. Create a dashboard (plotly) to visualize insights interactively
2. Improve predictive modeline for employee attrition
3. Enhance pay equity analysis with statistical testing
